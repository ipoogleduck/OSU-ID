# OSU-ID

## App Description:
Hate having to get your ID card out from your wallet or phone case every time you go out for food? Use the OSU Dining ID app to quickly pull up your card for dining dollars at OSU. Now it's as easy as a single swipe or tap on your phone to checkout.

Simply input your school ID number and add your ID card to your iPhone's wallet or as a widget on your Lock Screen. When you check out, just show the barcode on the card to the scanner. 

This app is student-made and is not an official app for Oregon State University. The app does not replace the magnetic strip or RFID capability of the official OSU student ID card, it only allows easier access to the barcode on the back of the card for dining services.

## Current state:
The app cannot be released on the App Store because students could too easily commit fraud by inputting another student's ID number and checking out with it.
